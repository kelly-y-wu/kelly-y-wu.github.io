abstract: Challenged by high rates of deforestation, fire, and carbon emissions, the Indonesian government initiated a forest moratorium to curb deforestation and protect the peatland (wetland) ecosystem. While previous studies have found that the moratorium moderately reduces forest loss rates in protected areas, this paper provides new evidence on its impact on fireâ€”another environmental hazard often associated with tropical deforestation. Using high-resolution satellite data and a matched difference-in-differences framework, I show that the moratorium fails to deliver co-benefits of fire reduction while curbing deforestation. Compared to land outside the moratorium boundaries, the protected peatlands are exposed to 18% more fires than in pre-treatment periods. The non-decreasing fires within the protected areas are not attributed to direct encroachment for oil palm expansion. Instead, the heightened fire risk during 2013-2015 resulted from spatial spillovers from the later converted plantations in the neighborhood. This finding suggests that without complementary measures of land management and fire monitoring, the place-based tropical forest conservation that officially removes the possibility of the protected land being held by private properties, may exacerbate fire risk and fail to achieve the broad goal of emission reductions.

summary: Using high-resolution time series of earth observations, this study evaluates the impact on tropical fires from a national scale moratorium of primary forests and peatlands in Indonesia. Results suggest that without complementary measure of land management and fire monitoring, the moratorium failed to deliever environmental benefits through reduced fires and smoke.
