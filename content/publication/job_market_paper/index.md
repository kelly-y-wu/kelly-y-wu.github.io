abstract: Confronted with high rates of deforestation, fire, and carbon emissions, the Indonesian government implemented a forest moratorium to halt land conversions by firms within protected forests and peatlands. This paper provides new evidence on its effect on fires, an environmental hazard closely associated with tropical deforestation. Using high-resolution satellite data and a matched difference-in-differences framework, I show that while the moratorium curbs deforestation, it does not reduce fire incidents. Protected peatlands within the moratorium boundaries exhibit an 18\% higher burn probability after the moratorium compared to pre-treatment periods, relative to non-protected areas. The increase in fires is not attributed to direct illegal encroachment for oil palm plantations but rather to cross-boundary degradation pressures from neighboring plantations not sanctioned by the moratorium. Land conversions within these neighboring plantations weaken the natural fire resilience of adjacent protected peatlands, creating conditions for widespread fires across degraded, vulnerable landscapes. This highlights a critical policy concern: without complementary land management, conservation efforts may be compromised by intensified fire risks in protected areas lacking active oversight.

summary: This study evaluates the impact of Indonesia's forest moratorium on fire activity, where fire is commonly used for agricultural preparation. While the moratorium has halted land conversions in protected areas, it has not achieved expected environmental benefits, such as reduced fires and smoke. The puzzle is unpacked utilizing the agricultural land use change captured by a time series of high-resolution Earth observations.
